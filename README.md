Setting Up Ansible for Azure Automation
This document outlines the steps taken to install and configure Ansible along with the necessary Python Azure SDK packages to enable Azure resource automation.

# 1. Install Ansible
Ansible was installed using Pythonâ€™s package manager:

bash - 
pip install ansible[azure]

This installs Ansible along with the Azure collection dependencies to allow Azure resource management.

# 2. Install Azure Ansible Collection
The Azure-specific Ansible modules are provided by the official azure.azcollection:

bash - 
ansible-galaxy collection install azure.azcollection 

Version 3.9.0 of the collection was installed, which is the latest stable release as of October 2025.

# 3. Install Python Azure SDK Packages
To handle Azure resources, Ansible depends on multiple Azure SDK libraries. These were installed inside a Python virtual environment using a consolidated requirements.txt file listing all required packages together with their versions.

Key installed packages include:

azure-common >= 1.1.28

azure-core >= 1.29.5

msrest >= 0.6.21

azure-identity >= 1.25.1

Various azure-mgmt-* packages for resource management (compute, storage, network, CDN, batch, data factory, resource health, and more) with versions mostly >= 1.0.0

microsoft-kiota-authentication-azure and msgraph-sdk for authentication and Microsoft Graph API support

# 4. Handle Beta Package Versions
Some packages such as azure-mgmt-resourcehealth and azure-mgmt-mysqlflexibleservers were available only as beta versions. These were installed by allowing pre-release versions in the requirements.

# 5. Verification
After installing Ansible, the Azure collection, and the Python SDKs, resource group creation and other Azure automation tasks using Ansible playbooks succeeded without import errors.
